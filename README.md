## Building for Production

### Android APK
```bash
# Build release APK
flutter build apk --release

# Install on device
flutter install
```

### iOS IPA (requires Mac + Xcode)
```bash
# Build for iOS
flutter build ios --release

# Archive in Xcode
# Upload to App Store Connect
```

### Alternative iOS Build (Cloud Services)
Use services like Codemagic or GitHub Actions for iOS builds without Mac:

1. **Codemagic**: 
   - Connect GitHub repository
   - Configure iOS certificates
   - Automatic build and distribution

2. **GitHub Actions**:
   - Use macOS runners
   - Configure secrets for certificates
   - Automated CI/CD pipeline

## Demo Credentials

For testing purposes, use any username and password with at least 6 characters.

**Example**:
- Username: `technician1`
- Password: `password123`

## API Integration

The app is designed to integrate with your existing customer database. Update the API endpoints in `app_config.dart`:

```dart
// Customer database integration
static const String baseUrl = 'https://thatoneamiho.cc';
static const String customerDatabaseEndpoint = '/customer-database.html';
```

Implement the following endpoints on your server:
- `GET /api/customers/search?q={query}` - Search customers
- `GET /api/customers/{id}` - Get customer details
- `POST /api/customers` - Create new customer
- `PUT /api/customers/{id}` - Update customer
