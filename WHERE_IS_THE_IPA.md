# 📱 WHERE IS THE IPA FILE? 

## 🎯 **IPA FILES ARE BUILT IN THE CLOUD, NOT LOCALLY!**

Your React Native app **CANNOT** generate an IPA file on Windows locally. Here's how it actually works:

### 🚀 **HOW TO GET YOUR IPA:**

#### Step 1: Upload to GitHub
- Go to: https://github.com/amiho-dev/tad-service
- Drag & drop ALL files from this folder
- Commit: "TAD Service App - Ready for IPA Build"

#### Step 2: Use GitHub Codespaces
- Click "Code" → "Codespaces" → "Create codespace"
- Wait 2-3 minutes for setup

#### Step 3: Build IPA in Codespaces
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start web version (instant preview)
npx expo start --web

# Build IPA file (cloud build - ~10 minutes)
npx eas build --platform ios --profile preview
```

#### Step 4: Download Your IPA
- Expo builds your IPA in the cloud
- You get a download link
- Install the IPA on iPhone (no App Store needed!)

## 🔧 **LOCAL WINDOWS ISSUES:**

The errors you're seeing are **typical Windows React Native issues**:
- `'bob' is not recognized` - Missing build tools
- `Cannot find module expo/bin/cli` - PATH conflicts
- `npm cleanup failed` - Windows file permission issues

### Local Quick Fix (if you insist):
Try running: `start_local.bat`

## 🎉 **WHY CODESPACES IS BETTER:**

| Local Windows | GitHub Codespaces |
|---------------|------------------|
| ❌ PATH issues | ✅ Works instantly |
| ❌ npm conflicts | ✅ Zero setup |
| ❌ No IPA builds | ✅ Cloud IPA builds |
| ❌ Complex setup | ✅ 3-minute start |

---

## 📋 **WHAT YOU GET:**

### Web App (Instant):
- ✅ Live URL: `https://amiho-dev.github.io/tad-service`
- ✅ Works on any device
- ✅ Auto-deployed via GitHub Actions

### iOS App (IPA):
- ✅ Built via Expo EAS Build (cloud)
